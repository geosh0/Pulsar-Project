Automated Pulsar Discovery & AI Classification
An end-to-end scientific pipeline for detecting and classifying pulsars using raw radio telescope data and Deep Learning.
🌌 1. Introduction: Why are we doing this?
What is a Pulsar?
Pulsars are the collapsed cores of dead massive stars. They are incredibly dense (a teaspoon weighs as much as a mountain) and spin rapidly, beaming radio waves across the universe like a cosmic lighthouse.
The Scientific Challenge
Finding them is like finding a needle in a haystack. Radio telescopes produce terabytes of noise (interference from satellites, lightning, and electronics), and hidden within that noise are faint, periodic signals from pulsars. Manual inspection is impossible at this scale.
The Goal
This project automates the hunt. We built a system that:
Processes raw telescope data to uncover hidden signals.
Generates candidate plots (visual representations of the signal).
Classifies those candidates using a custom Deep Learning model to distinguish real stars from man-made noise.
🔭 2. Data Acquisition: The CSIRO Portal
We utilized data from the Parkes Radio Telescope (The "Dish") via the CSIRO Data Access Portal. Specifically, we targeted the HTRU Survey (Project P630).
How to Navigate the Data
Radio astronomy data is not simple image files; it is raw binary voltage data. To find useful data for calibration, we didn't just download random files—we performed Targeted Searches.
The Strategy:
To verify our pipeline works, we needed files guaranteed to contain specific types of pulsars. We used a "Cone Search" (searching by sky coordinates) to find observations of known pulsars.
Our Calibration Targets:
PSR J0437-4715: The brightest Millisecond Pulsar (MSP) in the southern sky.
Purpose: Tests the pipeline's ability to detect extremely fast signals (5.75ms period) and binary orbits.
PSR J1048-5832: A "Normal" Pulsar in the Galactic Plane.
Purpose: Tests the pipeline's ability to handle high Dispersion Measure (DM) and background galactic noise.
Empty Sky: High-latitude observations.
Purpose: Provides "Negative" samples (Noise/RFI) to train the AI.
(Detailed instructions on how to replicate these searches are included in the docs/csiro_navigation.txt file).
⚙️ 3. The Search Pipeline (PRESTO Wrapper)
We built a custom Python automation wrapper around PRESTO, the standard software suite for pulsar processing. This pipeline handles the heavy physics calculations required to extract a signal from the noise.
The 5-Step Process
RFI Mitigation (rfifind): Scans the data for interference (satellites, radar) and creates a "mask" to ignore bad data. We implemented logic to relax masking for ultra-bright pulsars so they aren't accidentally deleted.
De-dispersion (prepsubband): Corrects for the delay caused by interstellar electrons (Dispersion Measure), realigning the signal across frequencies.
Universal Grid Search (accelsearch): The core innovation. Instead of guessing, we run three distinct search strategies on every file:
Iso_Slow: Optimized for isolated, slow-spinning stars.
Binary: Optimized for standard binary systems.
MSP_Fast: Optimized for millisecond pulsars in tight orbits.
Sifting: A logic filter that removes duplicate harmonics and groups detections.
Folding (prepfold): Stacks the data at the detected period to produce the final candidate plots.
🖼️ 4. Dataset Preparation
To train a robust AI, we needed a diverse dataset. A model trained only on one telescope would be biased. We constructed a Hybrid Dataset comprising:
HTRU Data (Internal): The candidates generated by our own pipeline (mostly noise, plus our targeted pulsar detections).
PALFA Survey (External): Known pulsars from the Arecibo Telescope.
GBNCC Survey (External): Known pulsars from the Green Bank Telescope.
Image Processing Pipeline
Raw plots are not AI-ready. We implemented a computer vision pipeline to standardize the data:

 High-Res PNG.
Cropping: We sliced every candidate plot into 4 specific "Vital Signs":
Profile: The pulse shape (1D curve).
Time-Phase: Signal stability over time (Waterfall).
Freq-Phase: Signal broadband nature (Waterfall).
DM Curve: Signal strength vs. Distance.
Labeling: We built a script to auto-label the data, assigning 1 (Pulsar) to known targets and 0 (Noise) to empty sky candidates, while preventing data leakage between Train/Test sets.
🧠 5. The Deep Learning Classifier
We designed a Multi-Input "Hydra" CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to classify the candidates.
Architecture
Unlike standard image classifiers that look at one picture, our model mimics a human astronomer. It analyzes four separate image streams simultaneously:
Stream A (Profile): Analyzes pulse shape.
Stream B (Time): Checks for signal continuity.
Stream C (Frequency): Checks for broadband signal.
Stream D (DM): Checks for correct dispersion.
These streams are processed by independent CNN branches and concatenated into a final decision layer.
Results
Precision: High rejection of false positives (RFI).
Recall: Successfully recovered 100% of the known pulsars in the test set.
Robustness: The use of multiple surveys ensures the model generalizes well to new, unseen data.
