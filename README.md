# Pulsar-Project
An automated pipeline for pulsar discovery using the PRESTO suite and Computer Vision. This project processes raw radio telescope data (CSIRO) to generate candidates, which are then classified by a custom Multi-Stream CNN trained on a hybrid dataset of HTRU, PALFA, and GBNCC survey data.
