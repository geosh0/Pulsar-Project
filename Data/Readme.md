# 💾 The Hybrid Dataset

This folder contains the processed data used to train and test the Deep Learning classifier. The dataset is a "Hybrid" construction, merging our internal discoveries with established external surveys to solve class imbalance.

## 📂 Folder Contents

### 1. Image Data (Zipped)
Due to GitHub file limits, the cropped candidate images are compressed:
*   **`CSIRO.zip`:** Candidates generated by our own pipeline processing of HTRU files (PSR J0437, PSR J1048, and associated noise).
*   **`PALFA.zip`:** Positive samples from the Arecibo L-band Feed Array survey.
*   **`GBNCC.zip`:** Positive samples from the Green Bank North Celestial Cap survey.

**The "4-View" Structure:**
Every candidate is represented by **four** distinct 128x128 images used by the Multi-Stream CNN:
1.  **Profile:** The integrated pulse shape (1D curve).
2.  **Time-Phase:** Signal stability over the observation (Waterfall).
3.  **Freq-Phase:** Broadband signal nature (Waterfall).
4.  **DM Curve:** Signal strength vs. Dispersion Measure.

### 2. The Master Labels (`PULSAR_DATASET.csv`)
This CSV acts as the "Brain" of the dataset. It links filenames to their ground truth labels.

**Schema:**

| Column | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `filename` | The unique ID of the candidate file (e.g., `J0025-19.fft`). |
| `label` | **1** = Real Pulsar, **0** = Noise/RFI. |
| `source` | Origin survey (`CSIRO_J0437`, `PALFA`, `GBNCC`). |
| `profile_path` | Absolute path to the profile image (used by the Data Loader). |
| `dm` | Dispersion Measure of the candidate (used for logic checks). |
| `group_id` | **CRITICAL:** The name of the actual pulsar source (e.g., `J1906+07`). |

> **Note on Data Leakage:** The `group_id` column is used during splitting to ensure that if a pulsar has multiple candidate images (harmonics/duplicates), **all** of them go into the same set (Train OR Test). This prevents the AI from "memorizing" a specific pulsar in training and cheating on the test.
